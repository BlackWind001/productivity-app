For the activity-label input:
- You should only be able to submit alphanumeric values
- Activity labels with spaces need a special implementation or a different error toast.

For the time-spent-on-activity input:
- You should only be able to submit numeric values
- You should be able to submit float values as well but only up to 2 decimal points.
- You should only be able to submit POSITIVE values that sum up to a total of 24 (for 24 hours)

For the entire form:
- I should only be allowed to submit when both the label input and the time input have been filled.
